# Sorting-Algo-Visualizer
<p>Algorithm Visualizer lets you visualize various algorithms and data structures. This project mainly focuses on three types of sorting algorithms</p>
<div>
      <ul>
  <li>Selection Sort:</li>    
     <p>   Selection Sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning.
        It divides the input array into two parts: the sorted subarray and the unsorted subarray.
        In each iteration, it selects the smallest element from the unsorted subarray and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
        Selection Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in all cases, where n is the number of elements in the array.
        It's not very efficient for large lists but is easy to implement.</p>

<li>Bubble Sort:</li>    
      <p> Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
        It passes through the list multiple times, and in each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position.
        Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, but O(n) in the best case (when the list is already sorted).
        Despite its simplicity, Bubble Sort is inefficient on large lists and is mainly used for educational purposes or for small datasets.
</p> 
 <li> Insertion Sort:</li>  
     <p>  Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking the next element from the unsorted part and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part.
        It starts with the second element (index 1) and compares it with the elements before it, shifting those elements one position to the right until it finds the correct position for the current element.
        Insertion Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, but it can perform well on small datasets or nearly sorted lists.
        It is efficient for small arrays or nearly sorted arrays because the number of comparisons and shifts is minimal.</p>
